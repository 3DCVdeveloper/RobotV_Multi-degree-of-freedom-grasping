End to end multi degree of freedom grasping and detection system based on point cloud

The end-to-end multi degree of freedom grasping and detection system based on point cloud integrates key components such as an electrical control cabinet, high-performance Elfin-E05 robot, high-precision Orbbec Gemini2 3D camera, powerful NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano development board, and precise pneumatic gripper system (including solenoid valve and air pump). The system achieves smooth communication between the robot and the camera through highly integrated design, as well as effective control of the gripper action by the electrical control cabinet. The detailed layout of the hardware architecture is shown in the diagram.
